I put both (release notes + forum announcement) into this source, so it will be easier to maintain them parallel:

Release notes
=============
4 new quests beginning in Fallhaven or south of it.
Achievements (listed as a quest, but with independent single entries).
29 new maps.

Fix of rounding issue regarding skills.
No more tapping out of loot window.
Quest steps in the quest log are now sorted in chronological order.
Combat log improvements.

Various other changes and bug fixes.
Translations actualized.

Finally a warning:
For any PERMADEATH characters it would be a good idea to save before updating.

Three other languages available: Japanese, Czech and Chinese.
