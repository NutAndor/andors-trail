"Foundation of the Forgotten Kingdom (year 2300)\n"
"The first humans, led by Arntuk the Mighty, came from the south in ancient times and established the Forgotten Kingdom. These people, called the Lethgar, built settlements in places where now great towns and cities are located. Nor City and Sullengard were the first to be founded.\n"
"Then some time later, a few explorers climbed Mount Galmore, the highest mountain in Dhayavar. Due to the elevation and marvelous view, their priests and mages built a sanctuary near the summit where they studied the arts of magic and worshipped their gods. \n"
"\n"
"Rise of Kazaul (year 2177)\n"
"The insane and powerful wizard called Valugha was obsessed with the notion of creating a portal to another plane. Even though his fellow mages disapproved, he was able to create a portal by consuming the powerful life essence of his brothers and the stored energy in the sanctuary. The sanctuary erupted in an explosion and a large ravine split Mt. Galmore apart. At its bottom, the portal opened, which was soon merely called the 'Rift', and the devastated area around it 'Undertell'. The mountain also spilled out lava like blood coming from a wound and is now clouded in smoke all the time.\n"
"All kinds of demons and undead emerged into the world through the portal, led by their masters, the 'Kazaul'. The Kazaul themselves were guided by the Eternal Masters who were incredibly skilled in magic and warcraft. Soon the monsters and their masters spread over whole of Dhayavar. However, the portal became unstable after a while and finally collapsed after several decades, but the harm was already done, as thousands of beasts had crept through it into the realm. \n"
"A short and brutal war was fought. With the loss of nearly all mages, the Lethgar were powerless against the monster invasion and were soon overthrown and enslaved by the Kazaul. The Kazaul imposed a reign of terror on the Forgotten Kingdom. It seemed no one was able to defeat or oppose the Kazaul due to their inhuman strength. \n"
"Then the Lethgar had to build underground lairs for their oppressors. A large city was built around the deactivated portal and in the natural caves under Mt. Galmore. Also, Carn Tower and the Sanctuary on Blackwater Mountain were built, among countless other underground Kazaul settlements.\n"
"Even though most Lethgar despised their masters, some showed interest in the rituals and dark sorcery of the Kazaul. As a result, the Kha'zaan (Kazaul cultists), a group of human Kazaul followers, gathered around their masters and learned from them. They were often used to enforce the brutal rule of the Kazaul. Many of the current monsters are living forms that evolved from experiments made during this era, such as Izthiels, Gornauds, Wyrms, etc.\n"
"By that time, the Hira'zinn, the omen of war, started plaguing the smallfolk. \n"
"\n"
"The War of Dawn and the Rise of Elythara and the Elytharan Union (year 1537)\n"
"One day, the Elytharan cultists arrived on the shore of the northern sea (Sea of Tears). They worshipped the blinding and cleansing light of Elythara. \n"
"The Elytharan mages and warriors were able to defeat the Kazaul and Kha'zaan with the help of the blinding light of Elythara which was forged\n"
"\n"
"[... here some pages were torn out ...]\n"
"\n"
"began erecting the city of Feygard on the shore of the Sea of Tears, which soon became a center of trade for the realm due to its access to the sea. \n"
"The town of Loneford was founded and it soon became famous for its fertile fields and healthy vegetable which fed the northern parts of the Forgotten Kingdom. \n"
"Blackwater Mountain was explored, and on its summit a large sanctuary for the Elytharan priests was erected to study dawn and dusk, the sun and stars, and to watch over the Forgotten Kingdom. Other sanctuaries were located in Feygard and Nor City, and shrines were found in each minor settlement. The mining colony of Prim was also founded after pioneers found rich sources of iron and coal under the mountain.\n"
"The city of Fallhaven became a prosperous center of trade due to its excellent location as a junction between the sanctuary of Blackwater Mountain, Stoutford, Nor City and Feygard. Big storehouses were built to safely store shipments. However, bands of thieves were soon attracted by the growing wealth, and united under one big organization, the Thieves' Guild, whose guild halls were secretly placed in Fallhaven, Feygard, and Nor City, those being the richest cities at that time. \n"
"Many other towns, including Brimhaven and Brightport were also founded around this time, and the Charwood mines were opened.\n"
"Trade agreements were signed between the cities in order to make trade prosper further. \n"
"\n"
"Establishment of the Aewatha Kingdom (year 432)\n"
"The head of the most important Nor City family, Garthan I of house Houdart, declared himself King, marking the end of the Elytharan era and the beginning of the Shadow-supported kingdom. At this point, political power and religious power became closely united. As the kingdom prospered, so did the Shadow, and Elythara\n"

"[... again some pages were torn out ...]\n"
"\n"
"as slaves for the digging. At that time the Flagstone Prison was also built, where runaway workers from Mt. Galmore were imprisoned and were left to rot. However the mines were closed after some years due to frequent monster attacks and other unspeakable horrors who dwelt in the dark.\n"
"Remgard was founded by Korhald of Remgard and built on a large island in Lake Laeroth. It became famous for its excellent smithing services. \n"
"The village of Crossglen was founded, and farmers settled there.\n"
"King Luthor ascended to the throne as the direct heir of King Oromir III and moved the capital from Nor City to Fallhaven, while the center of worship remained in Nor City. As King Luthor got older he felt the need for an advisor, and so Lord Geomyr of Feygard was named Hand of the King. He fulfilled his duty with great obsession and effort. \n"
"\n"
"The Noble Wars (year 25 to 14)\n"
"When King Luthor died, he left the Kingdom with no heir to the throne. He was buried in the catacombs under Fallhaven church. What followed, the Noble Wars, was one of the darkest periods this country has witnessed. \n"
"Four coalitions were formed which were each ruled by one powerful Lord. \n"
"The Western one consisted of Stoutford and the settlements on Blackwater Mountain, and was ruled by Lord Erwyn. \n"
"The Northern one consisted of Feygard, Thalgard, Luthaven and Remgard, and was ruled by Lord Geomyr. \n"
"The Eastern one consisted of Nor City, Sullengard, Brightport and Brimhaven, and was ruled by Lord Emeric. \n"
"The center capital area at first remained neutral and consisted of Fallhaven, Vilegard and Loneford (formerly administrated by King Luthor). \n"
"The Noble Wars started with the Landlords arguing about who was to be the new, legitimate, King. \n"
"The first stone was thrown by Stoutford. Lord Erwyn tried to use the time to attack the center area when the other Lords were busy debating. He wanted to occupy those to control the trade routes to Nor City, to gain the largest influence and to fracture other coalitions. Fallhaven was partially destroyed.\n"
"Erwyn's success was a short one, as he was attacked by the Eastern coalition. For several years, numerous battles and countless skirmishes were fought over control of the center area. When both Lords were weakened, Lord Geomyr attacked and forced both to surrender. The peace treaty of Fallhaven was signed and Lord Geomyr was proclaimed King.\n"
"The Hira'zinn haunted the lands once again during the war. \n"
"\n"
"The Rule of King Geomyr (year 14)\n"
"King Geomyr urged people to restore the destroyed cities and remove the traces of the long war. He reinstated a tax system, and garrisons of the Royal Guard of Feygard, in most of the villages. Geomyr promoted nepotism and corruption to further increase his power.\n"
"The cult of the Shadow became ever more important for the smallfolk. The commoners felt the need for salvation after the harsh period of the Noble Wars and accepted the Shadow as their guide into better times.\n"
"Lord Geomyr became fearful of the power of the religion, and tensions between Nor City and Feygard started to rise. He then proclaimed several prohibitions against the cult. They were no longer allowed to perform their rituals, and he tried to detain some of the priests. \n"
"Then he even banned the trade and use of heartsteel weapons as he feared they would be used to overthrow him.  He destroyed many weapons and confiscated others. Bonemeal potions were prohibited as well much to the disapproval of the smallfolk and the priests.\n"

"被遗忘王国的建立（2300年）\n"
"由强大的Arntuk领导的第一批人类是从远古时代的南方来的，建立了被遗忘的王国。这些被称为Lethgar的人在现在的大城镇和城市所在地建立了定居点。在其中，Nor City和Sullengard最早成立。\n"
"然后过了一段时间，一些探险家攀登了Dhayavar最高的山Galmore山。由于海拔和奇妙的景色，他们的祭司和法师在山顶附近建立了一个圣所，在那里他们学习魔法艺术并崇拜神灵。\n"
"\n"
"Kazaul的崛起（2177年）\n"
"疯狂而强大的法师Valugha迷上了创建通往另一个位面的门户的想法。即使他的同伴们不赞成，他仍然能够通过消耗兄弟强大的生命本质和圣所中储存的能量来建立门户。圣所在一次爆炸中爆发，Galmore裂开了。在其底部，门户打开了，该门户不久简称为“裂谷”，而周围被破坏的区域为“地下”。这座山还像伤口上的鲜血一样喷出了熔岩，现在一直乌云密布。\n"
"在其主人“Kazaul”的带领下，各种恶魔和不死生物通过门户出现了。 Kazaul自己由永恒的大师指导，他们在魔术和魔兽方面非常熟练。不久，怪物及其主人散布在整个Dhayavar。但是，门户在一段时间后变得不稳定，并在几十年后最终崩溃，但是危害已经造成，因为成千上万的野兽已经爬入了这个领域。\n"
"进行了短暂而残酷的战争。随着几乎所有法师的流失，Lethgar无力抵抗怪物的入侵，并很快被Kazaul推翻并奴役。Kazaul对被遗忘的王国实行恐怖统治。由于他们不人道的力量，似乎没有人能够击败或反对Kazaul。\n"
"然后，Lethgar不得不为压迫者建造地下巢穴。在停用的门户周围和Galmore山下的自然洞穴中建了一座大城市。此外，还建立了Carn 塔和Blackwater山的圣所，以及其他无数的地下Kazaul定居点。\n"
"即使大多数Lethgar鄙视主人，但也有一些人对Kazaul的仪式和黑暗巫术表现出兴趣。结果，一群Kazaul的追随者Kha'zaan（Kazaul的信徒）聚集在他们的主人身边，并向他们学习。他们经常被用来执行Kazaul人的残酷统治。当前的许多怪物都是从这个时代进行的实验演变而来的生命形式，例如Izthiels、Gornauds、冰龙等\n"
"到那时，战争的征兆Hira'zinn开始困扰小人们。\n"
"\n"
"黎明战争和Elythara和Elytharan 联盟的崛起（1537年）\n"
"有一天，Elythara的信徒们到达了北边海（泪之海）的岸边。他们崇拜Elythara的光明和洁净。\n"
"Elythara的法师和战士们在伪造的Elythara的致盲光的帮助下击败了Kazaul和Kha'zaan\n"

"【...这里有些页面被撕掉了...】\n"

"开始在泪之海的岸边建立Feygard，由于其通向大海，该市很快成为该领域的贸易中心。\n"
"Loneford镇成立后，很快便以其肥沃的土地和健康的蔬菜而闻名，它为被遗忘王国的北部提供了食物。\n"
"探索了Blackwater山，并在山顶上建立了一个大型的庇护所，以供Elythara的牧师研究黎明和黄昏，太阳和星星，并俯瞰被遗忘的王国。其他庇护所分别位于Feygard和Nor City，每个小居民区都有神社。在开拓者在山下发现了丰富的铁和煤资源之后，Prim的采矿殖民地也成立了。\n"
"Fallhaven因其优越的地理位置而成为繁荣的贸易中心，因为它是Blackwater山，Stoutford，Nor City和Feygard保护区之间的交汇处。建造了大仓库来安全地存放货物。但是，盗贼们很快就被不断增长的财富所吸引，并团结在一个大组织“盗贼公会”下，其公会大厅被秘密地安置在当时最富裕的城市Fallhaven，Feygard和Nor City。\n"
"大约在这个时候也建立了许多其他城镇，包括Brimhaven和Brightport，并开设了Charwood矿。\n"
"各城市之间签署了贸易协定，以使贸易进一步繁荣。\n"
"\n"
"Aewatha王国的建立（432年）\n"
"Nor City家族中最重要的家族之首，Houdart家族的Garthan一世宣布自己为国王，这标志着以Elythara时代的终结和暗影支持王国的开始。在这一点上，政治权力和宗教权力变得封闭联合的。随着王国的繁荣，暗影也繁荣了，Elythara\n"

"作为挖掘的奴隶。当时还建造了Flagstone监狱，那里有来自Galmore山的逃跑工人他们在里面被囚禁，腐烂了。但是，由于频繁的怪物袭击和其他无法形容的恐怖在黑暗中，矿山在几年后被关闭。\n"
"Remgard由Remgard的Korhald创建，建在Laeroth湖的一个大岛上。它以其出色的锻造服务而闻名。\n"
"Crossglen村成立，农民在此定居。\n"
"Luthor国王即Oromir三世国王的直接继承人登基，将首都从Nor City迁至Fallhaven，而礼拜的中心仍在Nor City。随着Luthor国王变老，他感到有必要聘请顾问，因此Feygard的Geomyr勋爵被任命为国王之手。他以极大的执着和努力来履行职责。\n"
"\n"
"贵族战争（25至14年）\n"
"Luthor国王去世后，没有王位继承人。他被埋葬在Fallhaven教堂的地下墓穴中。随后的贵族战争是这个国家目睹的最黑暗的时期之一。\n"
"四个联盟被组成了，每个联盟由一位强大的君主统治。\n"
"西部地区由Stoutford和Blackwater山的定居点组成，并由Erwyn勋爵统治。\n"
"北部地区由Feygard，Thalgard，Luthaven和Remgard组成，并由Geomyr勋爵统治。\n"
"东部地区由Nor City，Sullengard，Brightport和Brimhaven组成，由Emeric勋爵统治。\n"
"最初的中心首都地区保持中立，由Fallhaven，Vilegard和Loneford组成（之前由Luthor国王管理）。\n"
"贵族战争始于地主争辩谁将成为新的合法国王。\n"
"Stoutford扔了第一块石头。当其他勋爵正忙于辩论时，Erwyn勋爵试图利用这段时间攻击中心地区。他想占领那些地方，以控制通往Nor City的贸易路线，以获得最大的影响力并破坏其他联盟。Fallhaven被部分摧毁。\n"
"Erwyn的成功是短暂的，因为他遭到了东方联盟的攻击。几年来，为控制中心区进行了无数次战斗和无数次小冲突。当两位勋爵被削弱时，Geomyr勋爵发起进攻，并迫使双方投降。签署了Fallhaven和平条约，并宣布Geomyr勋爵为国王。\n"
"Hira'zinn在战争期间再次困扰着这片土地。\n"
"\n"
"国王Geomyr的统治（14年）\n"
"Geomyr国王敦促人们恢复被摧毁的城市，并消除长期战争的痕迹。他在大多数村庄恢复了税制和Feygard皇家卫队的驻军。Geomy提倡裙带关系和腐败，以进一步增强自己的力量。\n"
"对小人物来说，暗影的崇拜变得越来越重要。平民在贵族战争的残酷时期后感到需要救赎，并接受暗影作为他们进入更美好时代的向导。\n"
"Geomyr勋爵开始担心宗教的力量，Nor City和Feygard之间的紧张关系开始升温。然后，他宣布了对该邪教的若干禁令。他们不再被允许执行其仪式，并且他试图拘留一些牧师。\n"
"然后，他甚至禁止使用心钢武器的贸易和使用，因为他担心这些武器会被用来推翻他。他销毁了许多武器，并没收了其他武器。由于对于小人物和牧师的不赞成，骨粉药水也被禁止使用。\n"

However Elythara and her cultists failed to completely annihilate them, as a few Kazaul and followers managed to hide in remote places in the total darkness, unknown to the Elytharans. This is because although the Kazaul's dark spells were powerless against the blinding light of Elythara, Elythara's power is diminished deep underground in the total darkness. Nevertheless, for hundreds of years the Kazaul hibernated in the darkness.  \n"
"The visual appearance of her powers, as well as her perceived benevolence towards the commoners lead to people to call her the Goddess of Light. People were overjoyed about the defeat of Kazaul.  The Elytharans helped the people organize life and built several towns and cities, dedicated to their goddess. Several aristocratic houses were formed by that time. Each city was ruled by one or two houses who closely collaborated with the Elytharan priests.\n"
"A long era of peace and prosperity followed and the Elytharan Union was founded, to spread the word of Elythara over the whole realm. Even though the aristocrats ruled the cities, people were mainly influenced by the Elytharan priests.\n"
"Obviously, the world under Elythara wasn't perfect, although that's what her priests wanted people to believe. Her 'light' was shown to those who refused to follow the 'right' way, generally leaving them blind or worse... \n"
"The Elytharans soon began erecting the city of Feygard on the shore of the Sea of Tears, which soon became a center of trade for the realm due to its access to the sea. \n"
"The town of Loneford was founded and it soon became famous for its fertile fields and healthy vegetable which fed the northern parts of the Forgotten Kingdom. \n"
"Blackwater Mountain was explored, and on its summit a large sanctuary for the Elytharan priests was erected to study dawn and dusk, the sun and stars, and to watch over the Forgotten Kingdom. Other sanctuaries were located in Feygard and Nor City, and shrines were found in each minor settlement. The mining colony of Prim was also founded after pioneers found rich sources of iron and coal under the mountain.\n"
"The city of Fallhaven became a prospering center of trade due to its excellent location as a junction between the sanctuary of Blackwater Mountain, Stoutford, Nor City and Feygard. Big storehouses were built to safely store shipments. However, bands of thieves were soon attracted by the growing wealth and united under one big organization, the Thieves' Guild, whose guild halls were secretly placed in Fallhaven, Feygard, and Nor City, those being the richest cities at that time. \n"
"Many other towns, including Brimhaven and Brightport were also founded around this time, and the Charwood mines were opened.\n"
"Trade agreements were signed between the cities in order to make trade prosper further. \n"
"\n"
"Establishment of the Aewatha Kingdom (year 432)\n"
"The head of the most important Nor City family, Garthan I of house Houdart, declared himself King, marking the end of the Elytharan era and the beginning of the Shadow-supported kingdom. At this point, political power and religious power became closely united. As the kingdom prospered, so did the Shadow, and Elythara was forgotten by almost everyone in only a handful of generations. A large temple complex with a magnificent cathedral was built in the center of Nor City where the former shrines of Elythara had been located. Smaller churches were built across the country. People now commonly believed in the Shadow.\n"
"Garthan I ordered the exploration of the dreaded Mt. Galmore and a large mine was opened for a few decades where gems and gold were found in abundance.  Any remaining Elytharan followers were used as slaves for the digging. At that time the Flagstone Prison was also built, where runaway workers from Mt. Galmore were imprisoned and were left to rot. However the mines were closed after some years due to frequent monster attacks and other unspeakable horrors who dwelt in the dark.\n"
"Remgard was founded by Korhald of Remgard and built on a large island in Lake Laeroth. It became famous for its excellent smithing services. \n"
"The village of Crossglen was founded, and farmers settled there.\n"
"King Luthor ascended to the throne as the direct heir of King Oromir III and moved the capital from Nor City to Fallhaven, while the center of worship remained in Nor City. As King Luthor got older he felt the need for an advisor, and so Lord Geomyr of Feygard was named Hand of the King. He fulfilled his duty with great obsession and effort. \n"
"\n"
"The Noble Wars (year 25 to 14)\n"
"When King Luthor died, he left the Kingdom with no heir to the throne. He was buried in the catacombs under Fallhaven church. What followed, the Noble Wars, was one of the darkest periods this country has witnessed. \n"
"Four coalitions were formed which were each ruled by one powerful Lord. \n"
"The Western one consisted of Stoutford and the settlements on Blackwater Mountain, and was ruled by Lord Erwyn. \n"
"The Northern one consisted of Feygard, Thalgard, Luthaven and Remgard, and was ruled by Lord Geomyr. \n"
"The Eastern one consisted of Nor City, Sullengard, Brightport and Brimhaven, and was ruled by Lord Emeric. \n"
"The center capital area at first remained neutral and consisted of Fallhaven, Vilegard and Loneford (formerly administrated by King Luthor). \n"
"The Noble Wars started with the Landlords arguing about who was to be the new, legitimate, King. \n"
"The first stone was thrown by Stoutford. Lord Erwyn tried to use the time to attack the center area when the other Lords were busy debating. He wanted to occupy those to control the trade routes to Nor City, to gain the largest influence and to fracture other coalitions. Fallhaven was partially destroyed.\n"
"Erwyn's success was a short one, as he was attacked by the Eastern coalition. For several years, numerous battles and countless skirmishes were fought over control of the center area. When both Lords were weakened, Lord Geomyr attacked and forced both to surrender. The peace treaty of Fallhaven was signed and Lord Geomyr was proclaimed King.\n"
"The Hira'zinn haunted the lands once again during the war. \n"
"\n"
"The Rule of King Geomyr (year 14)\n"
"King Geomyr urged people to restore the destroyed cities and remove the traces of the long war. He reinstated a tax system, and garrisons of the Royal Guard of Feygard, to most of the villages. Geomyr promoted nepotism and corruption to further increase his power.\n"
"The cult of the Shadow became ever more important for the smallfolk. The commoners felt the need for salvation after the harsh period of the Noble Wars and accepted the Shadow as their guide into better times.\n"
"Lord Geomyr became fearful of the power of the religion and tensions between Nor City and Feygard started to rise. He then proclaimed several prohibitions against the cult. They were no longer allowed to perform their rituals, and he tried to detain some of the priests. \n"
"Then he even banned the trade and use of heartsteel weapons as he feared they would be used to overthrow him.  He destroyed many weapons and confiscated others. Bonemeal potions were prohibited as well much to the disapproval of the smallfolk and the priests."

"被遗忘王国的建立（2300年）\n"
"由强大的Arntuk领导的第一批人类是从远古时代的南方来的，建立了被遗忘的王国。这些被称为Lethgar的人在现在的大城镇和城市所在地建立了定居点。在其中，Nor City和Sullengard最早成立。\n"
"然后过了一段时间，一些探险家攀登了Dhayavar最高的山Galmore山。由于海拔和奇妙的景色，他们的祭司和法师在山顶附近建立了一个圣所，在那里他们学习魔法艺术并崇拜神灵。\n"
"\n"
"Kazaul的崛起（2177年）\n"
"疯狂而强大的法师Valugha迷上了创建通往另一个位面的门户的想法。即使他的同伴们不赞成，他仍然能够通过消耗兄弟强大的生命本质和圣所中储存的能量来建立门户。圣所在一次爆炸中爆发，Galmore裂开了。在其底部，门户打开了，该门户不久简称为“裂谷”，而周围被破坏的区域为“地下”。这座山还像伤口上的鲜血一样喷出了熔岩，现在一直乌云密布。\n"
"在其主人“Kazaul”的带领下，各种恶魔和不死生物通过门户出现了。 Kazaul自己由永恒的大师指导，他们在魔术和魔兽方面非常熟练。不久，怪物及其主人散布在整个Dhayavar。但是，门户在一段时间后变得不稳定，并在几十年后最终崩溃，但是危害已经造成，因为成千上万的野兽已经爬入了这个领域。\n"
"进行了短暂而残酷的战争。随着几乎所有法师的流失，Lethgar无力抵抗怪物的入侵，并很快被Kazaul推翻并奴役。Kazaul对被遗忘的王国实行恐怖统治。由于他们不人道的力量，似乎没有人能够击败或反对Kazaul。\n"
"然后，Lethgar不得不为压迫者建造地下巢穴。在停用的门户周围和Galmore山下的自然洞穴中建了一座大城市。此外，还建立了Carn 塔和Blackwater山的圣所，以及其他无数的地下Kazaul定居点。\n"
"即使大多数Lethgar鄙视主人，但也有一些人对Kazaul的仪式和黑暗巫术表现出兴趣。结果，一群Kazaul的追随者Kha'zaan（Kazaul的信徒）聚集在他们的主人身边，并向他们学习。他们经常被用来执行Kazaul人的残酷统治。当前的许多怪物都是从这个时代进行的实验演变而来的生命形式，例如Izthiels、Gornauds、冰龙等\n"
"到那时，战争的征兆Hira'zinn开始困扰小人们。\n"
"\n"
"黎明战争和Elythara和Elytharan 联盟的崛起（1537年）\n"
"有一天，Elythara的信徒们到达了北边海（泪之海）的岸边。他们崇拜Elythara的光明和洁净。\n"
"Elythara的法师和战士们在伪造的Elythara的致盲光的帮助下击败了Kazaul和Kha'zaan，致盲光被锻造进了他们的武器。Kazaul人几乎被减为零，因为他们的永恒大师被杀了。然而，由于一些Kazaul人和追随者设法躲藏在Elythara人不知道的完全黑暗的偏远地区，因此Elythara和她的信徒们没有彻底歼灭他们。这是因为尽管Kazaul的黑暗咒语在Elythara的刺眼光芒下无能为力，但在完全黑暗的地下深处Elythara的力量却减弱了。不管怎样，数百年来，Kazaul人在黑暗中冬眠。\n"
"她的力量的视觉外观，以及她对平民的仁慈使人们称呼她为光明女神。人们对Kazaul的失败感到高兴。 Elythara人帮助人们组织生活，并建立了几个献给女神的城镇。到那时，几个贵族家族就形成了。每个城市都由一两个贵族家族统治，这些贵族家族与Elythara的牧师密切合作。\n"
"漫长的和平与繁荣时代随之而来，成立了Elythara联盟，将Elythara的话语传播到整个领域。即使贵族统治了城市，人们还是主要受到Elythara牧师的影响。\n"
"显然， Elythara领导下的世界并不完美，尽管那是她的牧师希望人们相信的。向那些拒绝遵循“正确”方法的人展示了她的“光明”，通常使他们致盲甚至更糟……\n"
"Elytharans开始在泪之海的岸边建立Feygard，由于其通向大海，该市很快成为该领域的贸易中心。\n"
"Loneford镇成立后，很快便以其肥沃的土地和健康的蔬菜而闻名，它为被遗忘王国的北部提供了食物。\n"
"探索了Blackwater山，并在山顶上建立了一个大型的庇护所，以供Elythara的牧师研究黎明和黄昏，太阳和星星，并俯瞰被遗忘的王国。其他庇护所分别位于Feygard和Nor City，每个小居民区都有神社。在开拓者在山下发现了丰富的铁和煤资源之后，Prim的采矿殖民地也成立了。\n"
"Fallhaven因其优越的地理位置而成为繁荣的贸易中心，因为它是Blackwater山，Stoutford，Nor City和Feygard保护区之间的交汇处。建造了大仓库来安全地存放货物。但是，盗贼们很快就被不断增长的财富所吸引，并团结在一个大组织“盗贼公会”下，其公会大厅被秘密地安置在当时最富裕的城市Fallhaven，Feygard和Nor City。\n"
"大约在这个时候也建立了许多其他城镇，包括Brimhaven和Brightport，并开设了Charwood矿。\n"
"各城市之间签署了贸易协定，以使贸易进一步繁荣。\n"
"\n"
"Aewatha王国的建立（432年）\n"
"Nor City家族中最重要的家族之首，Houdart家族的Garthan一世宣布自己为国王，这标志着以Elythara时代的终结和暗影支持王国的开始。在这一点上，政治权力和宗教权力变得封闭联合的。随着王国的繁荣，暗影也繁荣了，Elythara在只有几代人的时间里就被几乎所有人遗忘。在Nor City的中心建造了一座带有宏伟大教堂的大型寺庙建筑群，那里曾经是Elythara神社的所在地。在全国各地建造了较小的教堂。现在人们普遍相信暗影。\n"
"Garthan一世下令探索这片可怕的Galmore山。在那里大量发现了宝石和金矿，在几十年间一个大型矿山开业了。所有剩余的Elytharan追随者都被作为挖掘的奴隶。当时还建造了Flagstone监狱，那里有来自Galmore山的逃跑工人他们在里面被囚禁，腐烂了。但是，由于频繁的怪物袭击和其他无法形容的恐怖在黑暗中，矿山在几年后被关闭。\n"
"Remgard由Remgard的Korhald创建，建在Laeroth湖的一个大岛上。它以其出色的锻造服务而闻名。\n"
"Crossglen村成立，农民在此定居。\n"
"Luthor国王即Oromir三世国王的直接继承人登基，将首都从Nor City迁至Fallhaven，而礼拜的中心仍在Nor City。随着Luthor国王变老，他感到有必要聘请顾问，因此Feygard的Geomyr勋爵被任命为国王之手。他以极大的执着和努力来履行职责。\n"
"\n"
"贵族战争（25至14年）\n"
"Luthor国王去世后，没有王位继承人。他被埋葬在Fallhaven教堂的地下墓穴中。随后的贵族战争是这个国家目睹的最黑暗的时期之一。\n"
"四个联盟被组成了，每个联盟由一位强大的君主统治。\n"
"西部地区由Stoutford和Blackwater山的定居点组成，并由Erwyn勋爵统治。\n"
"北部地区由Feygard，Thalgard，Luthaven和Remgard组成，并由Geomyr勋爵统治。\n"
"东部地区由Nor City，Sullengard，Brightport和Brimhaven组成，由Emeric勋爵统治。\n"
"最初的中心首都地区保持中立，由Fallhaven，Vilegard和Loneford组成（之前由Luthor国王管理）。\n"
"贵族战争始于地主争辩谁将成为新的合法国王。\n"
"Stoutford扔了第一块石头。当其他勋爵正忙于辩论时，Erwyn勋爵试图利用这段时间攻击中心地区。他想占领那些地方，以控制通往Nor City的贸易路线，以获得最大的影响力并破坏其他联盟。Fallhaven被部分摧毁。\n"
"Erwyn的成功是短暂的，因为他遭到了东方联盟的攻击。几年来，为控制中心区进行了无数次战斗和无数次小冲突。当两位勋爵被削弱时，Geomyr勋爵发起进攻，并迫使双方投降。签署了Fallhaven和平条约，并宣布Geomyr勋爵为国王。\n"
"Hira'zinn在战争期间再次困扰着这片土地。\n"
"\n"
"国王Geomyr的统治（14年）\n"
"Geomyr国王敦促人们恢复被摧毁的城市，并消除长期战争的痕迹。他在大多数村庄恢复了税制和Feygard皇家卫队的驻军。Geomy提倡裙带关系和腐败，以进一步增强自己的力量。\n"
"对小人物来说，暗影的崇拜变得越来越重要。平民在贵族战争的残酷时期后感到需要救赎，并接受暗影作为他们进入更美好时代的向导。\n"
"Geomyr勋爵开始担心宗教的力量，Nor City和Feygard之间的紧张关系开始升温。然后，他宣布了对该邪教的若干禁令。他们不再被允许执行其仪式，并且他试图拘留一些牧师。\n"
"然后，他甚至禁止使用心钢武器的贸易和使用，因为他担心这些武器会被用来推翻他。他销毁了许多武器，并没收了其他武器。由于对于小人物和牧师的不赞成，骨粉药水也被禁止使用。"
